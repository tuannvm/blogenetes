## Building Multiple LLM Agents with Dagger.io in Go

Dagger.io offers robust support for building LLM-powered agents in Go, enabling you to define modular, composable, and reproducible workflows. Here’s a detailed guide on how to structure your Go codebase for multiple agents and implement LLM integration.

### 1. Setting Up Your Go Dagger Module

**Initialize a Dagger module:**
```sh
dagger init --sdk=go --name=multiagent
```
This creates a Go module with the necessary Dagger scaffolding, including a `dagger.json` file and a Go package under `internal/` or `pkg/`.

To maximize agentic behavior in your Dagger-based blogging pipeline, you should design your system so that agents (RSS parser, summarizer, markdown generator, GitHub publisher) are not explicitly orchestrated in a fixed sequence by your code. Instead, you should expose each agent’s capabilities as Dagger Functions, provide them as tools in the environment, and let the LLM agent discover and invoke them as needed to achieve the end goal. This approach leverages Dagger’s native LLM integration and tool-use paradigm, making the workflow as agentic as possible.

## Key Principles for Maximum Agentic Behavior

### 1. **Expose All Agent Functions as Tools**
Each agent (RSS, summarizer, markdown, GitHub) should be implemented as a Dagger Function with clear inline documentation. When these functions are registered in your Dagger module, the LLM can automatically discover and use them as tools.

### 2. **Provide a Rich Environment**
Configure the environment to include all relevant objects (e.g., RSS URL as a string, directories for input/output, containers, etc.). The LLM will have access to these objects and the functions (tools) they expose.

### 3. **Use a High-Level Prompt**
Instead of scripting the workflow, provide a high-level prompt to the LLM describing the desired outcome (e.g., “Given an RSS feed, summarize the latest article, convert it to markdown, and publish it to GitHub Pages”). The LLM will analyze the available tools and decide which to use, in what order, and with what arguments.

### 4. **Let the LLM Orchestrate**
Do not hardcode the sequence of agent invocations. The LLM, acting as the orchestrator, will plan and execute the workflow by chaining tool invocations, inspecting outputs, and adapting as needed—this is the essence of agentic behavior.

## Example: Agentic Blogging Pipeline Structure

### **Go Module Structure**

```
internal/
  dagger/
    agent_rss.go         // RSS parsing agent
    agent_summarizer.go  // Summarization agent
    agent_markdown.go    // Markdown generator agent
    agent_github.go      // GitHub publisher agent
    shared.go            // Shared utilities
main.go                 // (Optional) Entrypoint for manual testing
dagger.json
go.mod
```

### **Agent Function Example (Go)**

Each agent exposes a function with documentation:

```go
// agent_rss.go
// FetchArticles fetches and parses articles from an RSS feed URL.
func (a *AgentRSS) FetchArticles(ctx context.Context, rssURL string) ([]string, error) { ... }

// agent_summarizer.go
// Summarize summarizes a given article using the LLM.
func (a *AgentSummarizer) Summarize(ctx context.Context, article string) (string, error) { ... }

// agent_markdown.go
// ToMarkdown converts a summary and title into a markdown file.
func (a *AgentMarkdown) ToMarkdown(ctx context.Context, summary string, title string) (*dagger.File, error) { ... }

// agent_github.go
// CommitToRepo commits a markdown file to a GitHub repository.
func (a *AgentGitHub) CommitToRepo(ctx context.Context, mdFile *dagger.File, repoURL string, branch string) error { ... }
```

### **Environment Setup**

Configure the environment to include:
- The RSS feed URL (string input)
- A directory for output files
- Any authentication tokens (for GitHub)
- All agent modules

### **LLM Prompt Example**

Instead of scripting the workflow, use a prompt like:

```
"You have access to tools for fetching articles from an RSS feed, summarizing text, converting summaries to markdown, and committing files to GitHub. Your goal is to process the latest article from the provided RSS feed, summarize it, save it as a markdown file, and publish it to the specified GitHub repository. Use the available tools as needed."
```

### **How the Agentic Flow Works**

- The LLM receives the environment and prompt.
- It discovers all available Dagger Functions (tools) via inline documentation.
- It decides to call `FetchArticles` to get articles, then `Summarize` on the latest article, then `ToMarkdown`, then `CommitToRepo`.
- If an error occurs or an intermediate step is unclear, the LLM can inspect outputs and adapt its plan, possibly retrying or using other tools.
- No explicit orchestration is required in your Go code—the LLM is the orchestrator.

---

## Why This Is Agentic

- **Autonomous Planning:** The LLM plans the workflow dynamically based on the tools and environment, not a hardcoded script.
- **Tool Discovery:** The LLM discovers and selects tools (Dagger Functions) at runtime.
- **Adaptability:** The LLM can adapt its plan based on intermediate results or errors.
- **Composable Agents:** Each agent is a composable, reusable module, and the LLM can chain them in any order as needed.

## Summary

To achieve maximum agentic behavior in your Dagger-based blogging pipeline:
- Expose each agent’s capabilities as Dagger Functions with documentation.
- Provide all tools and inputs in the environment.
- Use a high-level prompt describing the end goal.
- Let the LLM orchestrate the workflow by discovering and chaining tools, without explicit direction in your code.

This approach leverages Dagger’s LLM integration and tool-use paradigm, enabling true agentic workflows where the LLM acts as an autonomous orchestrator.
