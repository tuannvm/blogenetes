The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) official revealed that the hotline connecting air traffic control at Washington's Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) with the Pentagon has been non-functional since 2022. This issue came to light after an incident in January where an Army helicopter and a passenger jet collided at the Pentagon. The image shows a Black Hawk helicopter preparing to land at the Pentagon in July 2024.
