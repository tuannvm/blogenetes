The article discusses a critical issue with the hotline connecting air traffic control at Washington's DCA with the Pentagon. According to an FAA official, the hotline has not been functioning since 2022. This malfunction has serious implications, as it was highlighted by a recent incident where an Army helicopter collided with a passenger jet at the location in January. The need for a fully operational communication system between air traffic control and the Pentagon is crucial to ensure the safety and efficiency of air traffic in the area.
